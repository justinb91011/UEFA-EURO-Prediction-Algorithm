# UEFA EURO Score Prediction Algorithm
Welcome to the UEFA EURO Score Prediction project! This project leverages machine learning techniques 
to predict match scores and ultimately the winner of the UEFA EURO 2024 tournament. 
The dataset includes historical match results from UEFA EURO Championships from 1960 to 2020.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the outcomes of 
UEFA EURO 2024 matches. The predictions include match scores and the eventual winner of the tournament.

Dataset Information
The dataset contains comprehensive information about matches and 
results from the UEFA European Championship (EURO) from 1960 to 2020, and will be updated during EURO 2024.
